# Character-Level Text Generation with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to build a character-level language model using TensorFlow to generate text based on the works of Shakespeare. The model is trained on a portion of Shakespeare's text and is capable of generating new, similar text after training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy

To install the required dependencies, use:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
